# Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation

This is an implementation of NMF applied to missing data restoration. I upload it mostly because I wanted to tinker with Git, so if it’s useful for you, that’s really good!

You can see an explanation of the algorithm from: http://www.almoststochastic.com/2013/06/nonnegative-matrix-factorization.html
